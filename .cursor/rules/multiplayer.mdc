  All gameplay logic must be written in a way that allows easy extension to multiplayer in the future.
  Input handling, game logic, and networking must be clearly separated.
  Do not call Unity input functions (like Input.GetKey, Input.GetAxis, etc.) directly inside gameplay logic or controller classes.
  Use interfaces such as IPlayerInput to abstract input sources.
  Classes like PlayerController or GameManager should be decoupled from input sources (local or networked).
  Prefer event-driven architecture to allow easier client-server synchronization later.
